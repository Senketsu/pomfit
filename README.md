### About
Not that cute image and file uploader (originally made) for http://pomf.se 

### FAQ
Questions nobody asked, but here you have the answers.

**Why the version leap ? (0.2 -> 0.5)**  
In the mean time, I've actually developed two new version that I've never published for various reasons.
The version 0.3 (iirc) was in the works but was abandoned around the time when pomf.se ended it's services.
The version 0.4 was a shift to Nim that was almost finished but I forgot about it and it became obsolete code due to the Nim's development.

**Why is Pomfit still being developed ?**  
This project started as my first project after finishing learning basics of C and I wanted to hone my skills.
Also, I really needed something to substitute puush app for Linux. Thus the reason for me still playing around with this project.

**Why are you using Nim ?**  
It's a language I fell in love with long time ago. It immediately become my go-to language for all my free time projects.

**Why so active on GitHub all of a sudden ?**  
I had dumb practice of writting code and keeping it unpublished until I considered the version done and I cleaned up the code. 
Not utilizing GitHub as anything but publishing platform.
Reason was I had low self esteem in my code and I would stress over any possible bug or even a noobish comment in my code.
Yeah, I have my issues.. s-shad up b-baka !11!!
